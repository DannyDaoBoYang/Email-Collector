# Email-Collector
# Purpose

Created to automatcially extract German's Schools' Email address from their provincial databases. 

# Language

Lanuages used are bash and Python.

# Special Notes

I uploaded the whole directory here. So there might be things you don't really need. I'm removing them right now.

Each Http request has an interval of 3 seconds to 6 seconds, depending on my mood when I implemented the scripts.

The 3 to 6 seconds pauses are nessarcy to avoid being recognized as a robot, 

or generating too much trafic to your target website.

# Other Supporting Tools used

I also used BurpSuit to capture all outgoing/incomming request to furthur analyse them. You really need to pay attention
to details to find the pattern in those requests.
